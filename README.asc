Tor Browser Test Suite Ansible Playbooks
========================================

This repository contains ansible playbooks used to deploy the Tor Browser
test suite on some test VMs.


Creating a deploy user
----------------------

In order to use ansible to deploy on some servers, you need to have ssh
access on those servers with a 'deploy' user. This 'deploy' user should
have sudo access without password.

To create the 'deploy' user and give it sudo access, you can use the
'create_deploy_user.yml' playbook. Install ansible on the server, clone
this repository and run as root:

  # ansible-playbook -i localhost create_deploy_user.yml

If ansible cannot be installed on this server, you can manually create
the user, add an ssh authorized_keys file and give the user sudo access.


Initial setup
-------------

To do the intial setup, you can use the 'base_setup.yml' playbook. It
will install and enable ntpd, and install yum-cron or apt-cron to keep
the packages updated.


Deploying the test suite
------------------------

The main deployement is done using the 'site.yml' file. This is used to
deploy the testsuite on the test VMs, and the host that will receive
and publish the reports.

The following two groups are used:

- testsuite: the group of hosts where the testsuite should be deployed.

- reports: the host where the reports will be received and published.
